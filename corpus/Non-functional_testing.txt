***Non-functional testing***
Non-functional testing  is the testing of a software application or system for its non-functional requirements: the way a system operates, rather than specific behaviours of that system. This is in contrast to functional testing, which tests against functional requirements that describe the functions of a system and its components. The names of many non-functional tests are often used interchangeably because of the overlap in scope between various non-functional requirements. For example, software performance is a broad term that includes many specific requirements like reliability and scalability.
 Non-functional testing includes:
 
 Baseline testing 
 Compliance testing 
 Documentation testing 
 Endurance testing 
 Load testing 
 Localization testing and Internationalization testing 
 Performance testing 
 Recovery testing 
 Resilience testing 
 Security testing 
 Scalability testing 
 Stress testing 
 Usability testing 
 Volume testing
