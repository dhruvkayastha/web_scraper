***All-pairs testing***
In computer science,  all-pairs testing  or  pairwise testing  is a combinatorial method of software testing that, for  each pair  of input parameters to a system (typically, a software algorithm), tests all possible discrete combinations of those parameters. Using carefully chosen test vectors, this can be done much faster than an exhaustive search of all combinations of all parameters, by "parallelizing" the tests of parameter pairs.
